	title = {The {LHC} Run 2 {ATLAS} trigger system: design, performance and plans},
	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {In many high-energy physics experiments, online selection is vital to   collect the most interesting collisions out of the large data volume. The ATLAS experiment   at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) utilizes a trigger system that consists   of a hardware Level-1 (L1) and a software based high-level trigger (HLT),   reducing the event rate from the LHC bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz to an average recording rate of around 1000 Hz. In Run 2 of the LHC, started   in spring 2015, the LHC is operating at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV  providing an instantaneous luminosity up to 1.4 ⋅ 1034 cm−2s−1 so far.   The ATLAS trigger system has to cope with these challenges, while maintaining   or improving upon the efficiency to select relevant physics processes. In this   paper, the ATLAS trigger system for the LHC Run 2 is reviewed. Secondly, the   impressive performance improvements in the HLT trigger algorithms   used to identify leptons, hadrons and global event quantities like missing   transverse energy is shown. Electron, muon and photon triggers covering transverse   energies from a few GeV to several TeV are essential for signal selection   in a wide variety of ATLAS physics analyses to study Standard Model (SM) processes   and to search for new phenomena. Finally, further developments   planned for the rest of the LHC Run 2 are discussed. These include two new hardware   subsystems for topological selections at L1 and full-scan tracking at   the input to the HLT.}

It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

abstract = "ROOT is an object-oriented C++ framework conceived in the high-energy physics (HEP) community, designed for storing and analyzing petabytes of data in an efficient way. Any instance of a C++ class can be stored into a ROOT file in a machine-independent compressed binary format. In ROOT the TTree object container is optimized for statistical data analysis over very large data sets by using vertical data storage techniques. These containers can span a large number of files on local disks, the web, or a number of different shared file systems. In order to analyze this data, the user can chose out of a wide set of mathematical and statistical functions, including linear algebra classes, numerical algorithms such as integration and minimization, and various methods for performing regression analysis (fitting). In particular, the RooFit package allows the user to perform complex data modeling and fitting while the RooStats library provides abstractions and implementations for advanced statistical tools. Multivariate classification methods based on machine learning techniques are available via the TMVA package. A central piece in these analysis tools are the histogram classes which provide binning of one- and multi-dimensional data. Results can be saved in high-quality graphical formats like Postscript and PDF or in bitmap formats like JPG or GIF. The result can also be stored into ROOT macros that allow a full recreation and rework of the graphics. Users typically create their analysis macros step by step, making use of the interactive C++ interpreter CINT, while running over small data samples. Once the development is finished, they can run these macros at full compiled speed over large data sets, using on-the-fly compilation, or by creating a stand-alone batch program. Finally, if processing farms are available, the user can reduce the execution time of intrinsically parallel tasks — e.g. data mining in HEP — by using PROOF, which will take care of optimally distributing the work over the available resources in a transparent way.

The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CLs technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.
